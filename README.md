# Lithos OS
Lithos is an ambitious x86_64 microkernel-architected operating system being built from the ground up in Rust.

## Vision
Lithos aims to provide a safe, modular, and high-performance foundation for modern computing, leveraging Rust's zero-cost abstractions and memory safety.

## Current Progress
- [x] **Bare-metal Environment**: Custom target specification and `no_std` environment.
- [x] **VGA Text Driver**: Safe interface for screen output.
- [x] **Serial Logging**: Professional-grade debugging interface.
- [x] **Testing Infrastructure**: Integrated framework for verified development.
- [x] **CPU Foundation**: GDT, IDT, and Interrupt Handling.
- [x] **Memory Management**: Paging, Frame Allocation, and Heap Support.
- [x] **Multitasking**: Cooperative and Preemptive task scheduling with round-robin scheduler.
